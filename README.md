# IoT-Humidity-Sensor-with-NodeMCU-and-Firebase
This repository contains the source code and instructions for building an IoT humidity sensor using NodeMCU and Firebase. The project allows you to monitor the humidity levels in a specific location and visualize the data in real-time using the Firebase database and web application.

The NodeMCU board is used as the microcontroller to read the humidity values from the sensor and send them to the Firebase database. The Firebase real-time database is used to store and update the humidity values, which can be accessed from anywhere in the world. The web application displays the real-time data in a graphical format, providing a convenient way to monitor the humidity levels.

The repository includes the Arduino code for the NodeMCU board, as well as the Firebase configuration files and web application source code. The project is suitable for beginners who want to learn about IoT and Firebase, as well as experienced developers who want to build a simple and practical IoT application.
